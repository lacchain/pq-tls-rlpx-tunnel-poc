## TLS connections encapsulating Hyperledger Besu RPLx communication

This is a proof of concept for TLS encryption of the communication between two Hyperledger Besu nodes.

According to its specification, Ethereum nodes uses RLPx protocol for communication between nodes. This protocol carries encrypted messages using the ECIES method and all cryptographic operations are based on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

Instead of replacing the RLPx protocol, we created a TLS tunnel between the peers, and then we redirected all the RLPx traffic through it.

This proof of concept is built on top of [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) which relies on the _de facto_ standard [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for all the cryptographic operations.

## Configuration

There are two ways to test the TLS tunnel between the peers:

- using Docker: Follow the instructions as described inside the "docker" folder
- cloud configuration: Follow the instructions as described in the [cloud section](cloud/README.md) file.
